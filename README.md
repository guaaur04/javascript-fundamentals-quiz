# javascript-fundamentals-quiz

Hi, 

😁Welcome to my first Javascript Quiz😁
Go back in time with this simple style, and test basic Javascript knowledge. 

**How does the quiz work?**

* Questions will appear. You select a response. An alert will appear if you've scored a point. You will be prompted with the next question. 
* You have 20 seconds to complete the quiz
* When you answer incorrectly, 5 seconds will be subtracted by the timer. 
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
* 1 point automatically added for every correct answer
* When the game is over, you will be presented with your final score and an opportunity to submit initials and final score to the scoreboard
